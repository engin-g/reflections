Q1: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A1: When I'm collaborating with other people or trying to protect against data loss

Q2: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

A2: Because I might have made edits to my master or other branches. And I wouldn't be sure if I actually want the updates or not

Q3: Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A3: When I see a cool project that I want to experiment on, I fork it on GitHub. Also I can clone it to review code on my computer. I work with branches on local machine to add new features etc.

Q4: What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

A4: To be able to work without internet connection

Q5: How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

A5: It would be way harder. This way everything is structured and documented. Plus there are auto notifications.

Q6: When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

A6: Package a logical piece of work and prevent the master from being corrupted with experimental stuff
